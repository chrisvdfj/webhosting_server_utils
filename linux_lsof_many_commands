             # lsof -i @wonderland.cc.purdue.edu:513-515

       To list all files using any protocol on any port of mace.cc.purdue.edu (cc.purdue.edu is the default domain), use:

             # lsof -i @mace

       To list all open files for login name ââabeââ, or user ID 1234, or process 456, or process 123, or process 789, use:

             # lsof -p 456,123,789 -u 1234,abe

       To list all open files on device /dev/hd4, use:

             # lsof /dev/hd4


     To find the process that has /u/abe/foo open, use:

             # lsof /u/abe/foo

       To send a SIGHUP to the processes that have /u/abe/bar open, use:

             # kill -HUP âlsof -t /u/abe/barâ

       To find any open file, including an open UNIX domain socket file, with the name /dev/log, use:

             # lsof /dev/log

       To find processes with open files on the NFS file system named /nfs/mount/point whose server  is  inaccessible,  and presuming your mount table supplies the device number for /nfs/mount/point, use:

             # lsof -b /nfs/mount/point

       To do the preceding search with warning messages suppressed, use:

             # lsof -bw /nfs/mount/point

       To ignore the device cache file, use:

             # lsof -Di

       To  obtain  PID  and command name field output for each process, file descriptor, file device number, and file inode number for each file of each process, use:

             # lsof -FpcfDi

       To list the files at descriptors 1 and 3 of every process running the lsof command for login  ID  ââabeââ  every  10  seconds, use:

             # lsof -c lsof -a -d 1 -d 3 -u abe -r10

       To list the current working directory of processes running a command that is exactly four characters long and has an  âoâ or âOâ in character three, use this regular expression form of the -c c option:

             # lsof -c /^..o.$/i -a -d cwd

       To find an IP version 4 socket file by its associated numeric dot-form address, use:

             # lsof -i@128.210.15.17
