MYSQL A OTRO DISCO
You can often achieve better performance if your MySQL databases are stored on a drive other than your "main" drive. Thanks to M|22 for some guidance.

I am assuming that your second drive is mounted as /home2

The first step is to stop MySQL so that all your data gets copied correctly.
/etc/rc.d/init.d/mysql stop

We are going to make your new data directory /home2/mysqldata
cp -R /var/lib/mysql/ /home2/mysqldata

Set the correct owner and group, permissions are kept in the copying.
chown -R mysql.mysql /home2/mysqldata/

Remove your old data directory, we will just rename it but you can later delete it if you wish.
mv /var/lib/mysql/ /var/lib/mysql_old

Create a symlink from the old data location to the new one for any programs that rely on the common location.
ln -s /home2/mysqldata/ /var/lib/mysql

Set the correct owner and group on the symlink.
chown mysql.mysql /var/lib/mysql

Now that your data is moved we will edit the configuration file to update our changes. You do not have to do this since MySQL can follow the sym link we created but why make it follow the link if it doesn't have to.
pico /etc/my.cnf

Comment out the old settings and add a line for the new one as I have done here.

#datadir=/var/lib/mysql
datadir=/home2/mysqldata
#socket=/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock
socket=/home2/mysqldata/mysql.sock

#basedir=/var/lib
basedir=/home2

Exit and save

Start MySQL
/etc/rc.d/init.d/mysql start

If MySQL refuses to start look in /var/log/mysqld.log for the reason.
